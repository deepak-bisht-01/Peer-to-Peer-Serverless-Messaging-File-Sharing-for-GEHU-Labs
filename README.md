# Peer-to-Peer-Serverless-Messaging-File-Sharing-for-GEHU-Labs

At GEHU, faculty members regularly conduct lab sessions for CSE students. A common requirement during these labs is the quick and seamless distribution of files (e.g., starter code, datasets, configurations) to all students present in the lab. Currently, this is often done by uploading the files to a central server, drive link, or LMS, from where students individually download them. This approach introduces several issues, including dependency on internet connectivity, unnecessary server load, single point of failure, and added delays.
